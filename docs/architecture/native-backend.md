# Native backend contract

`inauguration` owns these backend paths today:

1. **Bytecode VM subset** (all hosts): supported Core IR fronts lower to textual SIL, then to `.bca` bytecode assembly, then execute in the in-tree stack VM.
2. **Native exit-stub subset** (`aarch64-apple-darwin` only): scalar-return entry functions in the Core IR subset are const-evaluated through the bytecode pipeline and emitted as a tiny owned Mach-O executable that exits with the evaluated code. No `swiftc`, `clang`, or linker invocation occurs on this path.
3. **Target-triple object/module subsets**: selected non-host triples emit inspectable object, archive, module, or minimal executable artifacts for const-evaluable scalar entry functions without invoking an external linker or language compiler.

Swift sources can still use `swiftc` for textual SIL or SwiftPM staging via `in build`, but that is a toolchain escape hatch, not the owned native backend. Use `in compile --target native` for owned native output; pass `--allow-external-toolchain` on `in build` only when external Swift/swiftc fallback is intentional.

On Apple Silicon macOS, `in compile --path apps/polyglot-sample/sample.in --target native --entry answer --out target/in/answer-sample` produces an owned executable that exits `42`. On Linux and other hosts, the same command reports `native-backend-not-implemented` and bytecode remains the primary owned executable path.

`in backend --path <file> --target bytecode --json` reports the owned bytecode backend and artifact facts for supported inputs. `in backend --target native --json` mirrors the host-specific native status above.

The target registry also carries checked-in In target equivalents for the Rust target triple matrix. These names are compiler target identities for planning, reports, manifests, and future lowering work. They do not imply object emission, linking, ABI lowering, or a native runtime until a target-specific backend is implemented and tested in this repository.

The first non-host object backends are `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`, `armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf`, and `wasm32-unknown-unknown` for const-evaluable scalar entry functions. `in compile --target native --target-triple x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu --linkage static-lib --entry answer --out target/answer.o` emits an ELF64 relocatable object with x86_64 machine code returning the evaluated scalar value. `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` emits an ELF64 AArch64 relocatable object for the same scalar subset. `armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf` emits an ELF32 ARM relocatable object for the same scalar subset. `wasm32-unknown-unknown` emits a WebAssembly module exporting the scalar function.

`in compile --target native --target-triple aarch64-apple-darwin --linkage static-lib --entry answer --out target/libanswer.a` emits an `ar` archive containing a Mach-O ARM64 object member with an exported `_answer` symbol. This is a static archive route, not a bare Mach-O object route.

`in compile --target native --target-triple x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu --linkage executable --entry answer --out target/answer` emits a minimal ELF64 Linux executable that exits with the const-evaluated scalar value through the Linux `exit` syscall. This is not general x86_64 native lowering: it has no linker, libc, dynamic loader, relocations, argv/envp contract, heap, imports, or general function ABI support.

`aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` and `armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf` also emit minimal Linux executables for the same const-evaluated scalar subset. They use target-native Linux `exit` syscalls and are checked structurally on all hosts, with QEMU runtime checks when `qemu-aarch64` or `qemu-arm` is installed.

`in compile --target native --target-triple x86_64-pc-windows-msvc --linkage executable --entry answer --out target/answer.exe` emits a PE32+ AMD64 console executable whose entry returns the const-evaluated scalar value. It does not import `kernel32`, link a CRT, or claim Windows ABI/runtime coverage beyond this minimal entry-return artifact.

`in compile --target native --target-triple aarch64-apple-darwin --linkage executable --entry answer --out target/Answer.app` emits a macOS `.app` bundle containing the owned AArch64 Mach-O executable plus `Info.plist` and `PkgInfo`. A normal host executable path without `.app` remains the host native route.

`in compile --target native --target-triple x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu --linkage executable --entry answer --out target/Answer.AppDir` emits a Linux AppDir with an `AppRun` ELF executable and desktop entry. `.AppImage` remains fail-closed with `native-package-not-implemented` until the repository owns an AppImage runtime and SquashFS writer.

Explicit `--target-triple` requests fail closed when the owned backend has no target/linkage implementation. They do not fall through to the host Mach-O path.

The runnable cross-artifact example lives in `apps/native-artifact-sample/`. Run `bash scripts/check-native-artifact-sample.sh` to build and inspect the supported ELF, PE, Mach-O bundle, AppDir, object, archive, and WASM outputs from one `.in` source file.

`bash scripts/check-native-linkable-objects.sh` links the x86_64 ELF relocatable object into a C harness and runs it on Linux x86_64 hosts with `cc`; other hosts skip that runtime gate.

## Compile cache (Wave 6)

`in compile` hashes source path + content into `target/in/cache/<frontend_hash>/metadata.json`, storing the serialized owned compile report (including `frontend_hash`). Repeated compiles with the same frontend input reuse cached metadata when target, entry, and module id match.

## Scope

The native backend is the stage after source fronts, Core IR, textual SIL, and SIL analysis. It is responsible for turning a checked program into a runnable artifact without silently delegating code generation to a language toolchain.

| Area | First contract |
|------|----------------|
| Input | A checked Core IR subset with explicit functions, locals, calls, returns, and scalar values. |
| Output | `.bca` bytecode assembly on all hosts; Mach-O exit stubs on `aarch64-apple-darwin` for const-evaluable scalar entry functions. |
| Runtime | Only the runtime pieces present in this repository may be claimed. |
| Diagnostics | Unsupported constructs fail closed with `native-backend-not-implemented` or a narrower backend reason code. |
| Observability | Backend reports include input language, frontend level, IR stage, backend stage, artifact kind, timing, jobs, cache hit, and reason codes. |

## Non-goals for the first backend slice

- No claim of arbitrary Swift, C++, Rust, Go, V, JavaScript, Python, JVM, CLR, or Ruby native execution on every host.
- No silent `swiftc`, `clang`, `rustc`, `go`, `v`, or system linker fallback on a self-hosted native path.
- No broad ABI promise before the value model, call convention, symbols, object format, and runtime ownership are documented with tests.

## Integration points

- `docs/architecture/universal-compiler-roadmap.md`: keeps the native runtime spine and production-claim ladder honest.
- `docs/architecture/general-compiler.md`: defines the current source front to Core IR to textual SIL path.
- `in-cli/src/native_backend.rs`: owns backend status records for bytecode and native targets.
- `in-cli/src/native_emit/`: emits the aarch64 Mach-O exit stub.
- `in-cli/src/compile_cache.rs`: owns compile metadata cache under `target/in/cache/`.
- `in-cli/src/owned_compile.rs`: owned `in compile` pipeline and reports.
